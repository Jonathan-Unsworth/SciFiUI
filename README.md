# SciFi UI Project

Name: Jonathan Unsworth

class: DT228 - 2

# Description of the assignment
The aim of this assignment is to development a visual interface for a SciFi user interface.
To achieve this goal the Java programming language and the processing environment are in used in tandem.
OOP Paradigms such as inheritence and polymorphism are used to create the interface.

I decided that my version of this assignment would be an interface that would relay visual information through a graph, a barchart and a piechart. My aim was to develop something you would expect to find on a ship like on Star Trek.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
